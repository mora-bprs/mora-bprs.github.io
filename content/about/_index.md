The Vision Based Bin Picking Robot Arm project is an Engineering Design Project undertaken by a team of students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. The project aims to develop a robotic system capable of identifying and picking objects from a bin using computer vision techniques.

## Our Team

The project is being carried out by a dedicated team of seven students, each bringing their unique skills and expertise to the table:

1. **W.A. Odil Janandith** (EvilOdil)
2. **Isiri Withanawasam** (isiri01)
3. **Kavindu Jayathissa** (KavinduJ2001)
4. **Kavishka Abeywardana** (kavishka-dot)
5. **L.H. Hirusha Maduwantha** (maduwanthasl)
6. **Rajitha Niroshan** (niroshan21)
7. **Sasika Amarasinghe** (SasikaA073)
8. **Thuvaragan Sooriyakumaran** (thuvasooriya)

Under the guidance of our supervisors, we are working tirelessly to integrate computer vision algorithms, robotic control systems, and mechanical design to create a fully functional bin picking solution. Our goal is to develop a system that can be applied in various industrial settings, improving efficiency and automation in material handling processes.

We are constantly striving to push the boundaries of what is possible, and we are excited to share our progress and insights with the wider community. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
