{"/about/":{"data":{"":"The Vision Based Bin Picking Robot Arm project is an Engineering Design Project undertaken by a team of students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. The project aims to develop a robotic system capable of identifying and picking objects from a bin using computer vision techniques.","our-team#Our Team":"The project is being carried out by a dedicated team of seven students, each bringing their unique skills and expertise to the table:\nW.A. Odil Janandith (EvilOdil) Isiri Withanawasam (isiri01) Kavindu Jayathissa (KavinduJ2001) Kavishka Abeywardana (kavishka-dot) L.H. Hirusha Maduwantha (maduwanthasl) Rajitha Niroshan (niroshan21) Sasika Amarasinghe (SasikaA073) Thuvaragan Sooriyakumaran (thuvasooriya) Under the guidance of our supervisors, we are working tirelessly to integrate computer vision algorithms, robotic control systems, and mechanical design to create a fully functional bin picking solution. Our goal is to develop a system that can be applied in various industrial settings, improving efficiency and automation in material handling processes.\nWe are constantly striving to push the boundaries of what is possible, and we are excited to share our progress and insights with the wider community. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would like to collaborate."},"title":"About"},"/blog/guides/":{"data":{"":"","contributing#Contributing":" This guide assumes that you have previous experience with handling banches and private repos, if you want a more beginner friendly approach use the github commandline utility gh which will setup all the authetications and remote url handling for you. We are using the hextra template for our documentation site. And choosing the git submodule route to install the theme. Follow the steps to get the site working first and then add the content. Install Hugo\nHugo is a fast Static Site generator written in golang, hence you have to install it to compile your templates to web format. You can follow the installation instructions provided on the official Hugo website. Clone the Repository with submodules and Navigate to the Directory\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mora-bprs/mora-bprs.github.io.git \u0026\u0026 cd mora-bprs.github.io Start Editing the Site:\nRefer to this hugo theme documentation to edit the pages. You can start editing the Hugo site by modifying the content files located in the content directory. They can use Markdown syntax to write content and make changes as needed. First create a folder with the slug name in the content folder, then create an index.md file in that folder and write the content in it. hugo server -D will give a preview of your site in localhost:1313 template for index.md file:\n--- title: \"Title of the page\" date: 2024-03-03 authors: - name: imfing link: https://go.io tags: - Markdown - Example - Guide draft: false --- ## Sample Markdown content Here write the content of the page in markdown syntax. Useful Commands Preview Changes Locally:\nTo preview their changes locally, you can run the Hugo development server: hugo server -D #or hugo server --buildDrafts --disableFastRender This command starts a local web server, and you can view the site in their web browser at http://localhost:1313.\nGenerate the changes locally:\nTo generate the changes locally, you can run the Hugo command: hugo --destination docs This command generates the static files in the docs directory.\nCommit Changes to the respective Branch:\nCreate a new branch when you run this for the first time.\ngit checkout -b \u003cnewbranchname\u003e # example: git checkout -b thuva If this is not your first time working with dev branch do the following.\nAfter making changes, you should commit their changes to the “dev” branch:\nWhen multiple people are working it is recommended to create a branch using your name or something unique to your team and commit to that branch to avoid merge conflicts and remote HEAD conflicts.\nSasika: dev branch Thuva: thuva branch git checkout \u003cbranchname\u003e git add . git commit -m \"Description of changes made\" git push origin \u003cremotebranchname\u003e Updating Submodules\ngit submodule update --remote Acknowledgments Using Hugo Theme [https://github.com/imfing/hextra] "},"title":"Getting Started"}}
