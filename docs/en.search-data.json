They can follow the installation instructions provided on the official Hugo website. Start Editing the Site:\nDevelopers can start editing the Hugo site by modifying the content files located in the content directory. They can use Markdown syntax to write content and make changes as needed. Preview Changes Locally:\nTo preview their changes locally, developers can run the Hugo development server: hugo server -D\rThis command starts a local web server, and developers can view the site in their web browser at http://localhost:1313. Commit Changes to the “dev” Branch:\nAfter making changes, developers should commit their changes to the “dev” branch: git checkout dev\rgit add .\rgit commit -m \"Description of changes made\"\rgit push origin dev\rSubmit Pull Requests (Optional):\nIf your workflow involves code reviews, developers can submit pull requests from the “dev” branch to other branches (e.g., “main” for production). This allows for review and collaboration before merging changes. Deploy to Production (Optional):\nOnce changes are ready to be deployed to production, you can merge the “dev” branch into the appropriate branch (e.g., “main”) to trigger a deployment. By documenting these steps, developers will have a clear understanding of how to clone, edit, and push updates to the Hugo site hosted in the “mora-bprs.github.io” repository, helping to streamline the development process."},"title":"How to get started"}}
